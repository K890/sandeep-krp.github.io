The website is intended to provide blogs on different technical topics. Maybe in the future we will also publish some opinions around Software development but for now, let's focus on the geeky stuff.

The blogs are written by Sandeep Kumar who is a software engineer by profession having more than 10 years of experience in product development. He has a deep understanding of the product development processes since he has played all technical roles right from a junior developer to a technical lead. After developing web based projects using Hadoop and cloud technologies, Sandeep is exploring the adventures of DevOps and SRE.
